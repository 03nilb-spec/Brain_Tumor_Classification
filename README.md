# Brain_Tumor_Classification
Deep learning-based brain tumor classification using MRI images with Streamlit deployment.

## Live Demo
Try the web app here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Brain Tumor Classification Streamlit App](https://braintumorclassification-7rmjvhrnwtp2g69v78fklc.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- Custom CNN and Pretrained (Transfer Learning) models.
- Model performance comparison.
- Streamlit web app to predict tumor type from uploaded MRI images.
- Clean, modular, and well-documented code.

## Tumor Classes
1. **Glioma**
2. **Meningioma**
3. **Pituitary**
4. **No Tumor**
